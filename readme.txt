== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Cycle? =
Cycle is a WordPress Gutenberg plugin that allows you to create and manage multiple content variations within the same page or post. Visitors will see different content each time they refresh the page or at set intervals.

= How does the content variation work? =
You can create as many variations as you want. In the free version, these are shown in shuffle (random) mode. You can control how often a new variation is shown—on refresh, or every day, week, or month.

= Can I use Cycle for A/B testing? =
Yes! Cycle supports basic A/B testing by allowing you to rotate different versions of content and track engagement using external tools.

= Does Cycle support UTM tracking? =
UTM support is available in the **Pro version** of Cycle. You can attach unique UTM codes to each variation to track performance across campaigns.

= How does Cycle benefit SEO? =
Cycle helps keep your content fresh and engaging. By reducing bounce rates and increasing time on site, it sends positive signals to search engines about your site’s relevance and activity.

= Can I control how often the content changes? =
Absolutely. You can configure content to change on every page refresh, or on a daily, weekly, or monthly interval.

= Is Cycle easy to use for beginners? =
Yes. Cycle is built to work seamlessly with the Gutenberg editor and doesn't require any coding skills.

= Does Cycle affect site performance? =
No. Cycle is lightweight and optimized for performance. It runs only when needed and doesn't impact page speed or load times.

= How is a Cycle triggered? =
While all cycles are set at scheduled intervals, each new cycle is triggered by user site traffic. More specifically, when a user visits the page where the cycle lite block is embedded.
